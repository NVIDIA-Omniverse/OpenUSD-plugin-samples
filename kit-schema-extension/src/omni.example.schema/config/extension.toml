# when an extension is requested to be enabled, kit will load the python modules

# this one will register the plugin with USD so it knows in what module to 
# find our schema types

# this tells kit to load these C++ libraries when the extension loads
# (kit will also try to unload them when the extension is unloaded)
# note that this is required to also make loading the schema python module work
# (importing the schema python module will look for the C++ library as a dependency)
# if you don't load the C++ lib here, your PATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables
# should contain the path to your C++ dll otherwise the python module will
# not load properly!

# and integrate repo_test in kit-schema-extension as it is done in usd-schema-extension
